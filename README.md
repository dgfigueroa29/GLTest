## Mobile Technical Interview

Create an app that shows a simple list of items based on the following endpoint:

http://private-f0eea-mobilegllatam.apiary-mock.com/list

The app should **show the following data** :

* Title (at its full length, so take this into account when sizing your cells)
* Part of description
* A thumbnail for those who have a picture.
* Display a detail (with an image and full description) in a new screen when user
taps on an item

To do this please follow this **guidelines** :
* Use github as VCS and share the code with us.
* For Android apps, use Java. For iOS, use Swift 4.
* Support portrait and landscape mode.

Some **notes** :
* If you don’t have the time to complete the full exercise, don’t worry. Just do your
best in the time you have and then let us know.
* Keep in mind that some information from api could be wrong
* You can use any framework or library
* The assessment of the app won’t be only related to code quality but architecture
design too.
